Eklvya
======

 

Eklavya is an epic character from Indian mythology. He achieved pinnacle of
performance in archery without any coach or teacher. He achieved it by
practicing & practicing only. Please refer wiki
[Ekalavya](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekalavya>) to know more about this
inspiring character.

There are so many Eklavyas in society today. They are unable to reach their
genetic potential. From many reasons responsible for it, **availability of
coaches** is biggest concern. Second concern is with respect to **quality basic
training**.

Eklavya Platform is designed to address this challenging concerns with help of
technology. We are different because we want to make it **affordable for all**.
We are starting with **Boxing**.

    Processing ([Download here](<https://processing.org>)) ; R ([Download
    here](<https://cran.rstudio.com>))

Please install above mentioned softwares if they are not available. All these
softwares are open source.

### Hardware :

-   Arduino Board (Plese compile and check whether it can be compiled &
    downloaded on board)

-   9 Axis Motion Shield (click
    [here](<http://www.arduino.org/products/shields/5-arduino-shields/arduino-9-axes-motion-shield>)
    for more details)

-   Bluetooth HC-05 is optional.

Procedure
---------

-   Arduino :

    -   Start Arduino IDE and open sketch **EEklvyA\_V1.0.ino** available in
        Eklavya\_V1.0

    -   Compile and upload the code.

    -   Check up on serial monitor whether data stream is received.

-   R :

    -   Start R and open **R\_ini.R**

    -   Execute all commands line by line

-   Processing :

    -   Start Processing and open sketch **Eklvya.pde** and configure com port
        where arduino is working (Supports HC-05 bluetooth module as of now)

    -   First window of API will show about 9 Axis sensor calibration.

        -   Just move sensor shield in 8 motion as shown in picture

        -   Keep sensor shield on flat surface for next calibration
