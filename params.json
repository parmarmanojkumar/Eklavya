They are unable to reach their\r\ngenetic potential. From many reasons responsible for it, **availability of\r\ncoaches** is biggest concern. Second concern is with respect to **quality basic\r\ntraining**.\r\n\r\nEklavya Platform is designed to address this challenging concerns with help of\r\ntechnology. We are different because we want to make it **affordable for all**.\r\nWe are starting with **Boxing**.\r\n\r\n>   Success is where **preparation and opportunity** meet. - Bobby Unser\r\n\r\n-   \\#Eklvya is here **to help you prepare** so when you meet with opportunity,\r\n    your chances for success is increased by manifolds.\r\n\r\n>   I am building a fire, and **everyday I train**, I add more fuel. At just the\r\n>   right moment, I light the match. - Mia Hamm\r\n\r\n-   \\#Eklvya is here **to help you train everyday** so you add up rocket fuel\r\n    (not regular fuel) to your sports fire.\r\n\r\nTeam \\#Eklvya\r\n=============\r\n\r\n-   Dileep Prabhu ([Facebook](<https://www.facebook.com/dileep.prabhu.94>))\r\n\r\n-   Manojkumar Parmar ([Github](<https://github.com/parmarmanojkumar>),\r\n    [Twitter](<https://twitter.com/mparmar47>))\r\n\r\n-   Shreyas Shan ([Github ](<https://github.com/shrey-shan>),\r\n    [Facebook](<https://www.facebook.com/shreyshan>))\r\n\r\nHow to use it?\r\n==============\r\n\r\nPrerequisite :\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n### Software :\r\n\r\n-   OS : Windows 7 & onwards ; Mac OSx (Leopard onwards)\r\n\r\n-   Software : Arduino ([Download here](<http://www.arduino.org/software>)) ;\r\n    Processing ([Download here](<https://processing.org>)) ; R ([Download\r\n    here](<https://cran.rstudio.com>))\r\n\r\nPlease install above mentioned softwares if they are not available. All these\r\nsoftwares are open source.\r\n\r\n### Hardware :\r\n\r\n-   Arduino Board (Plese compile and check whether it can be compiled &\r\n    downloaded on board)\r\n\r\n-   9 Axis Motion Shield (click\r\n    [here](<http://www.arduino.org/products/shields/5-arduino-shields/arduino-9-axes-motion-shield>)\r\n    for more details)\r\n\r\n-   Bluetooth HC-05 is optional.\r\n\r\nProcedure\r\n---------\r\n\r\n-   Arduino :\r\n\r\n    -   Start Arduino IDE and open sketch **EEklvyA\\_V1.0.ino** available in\r\n        Eklavya\\_V1.0\r\n\r\n    -   Compile and upload the code.\r\n\r\n    -   Check up on serial monitor whether data stream is received.\r\n\r\n-   R :\r\n\r\n    -   Start R and open **R\\_ini.R**\r\n\r\n    -   Execute all commands line by line\r\n\r\n-   Processing :\r\n\r\n    -   Start Processing and open sketch **Eklvya.pde** and configure com port\r\n        where arduino is working (Supports HC-05 bluetooth module as of now)\r\n\r\n    -   First window of API will show about 9 Axis sensor calibration.\r\n\r\n        -   Just move sensor shield in 8 motion as shown in picture\r\n\r\n        -   Keep sensor shield on flat surface for next calibration\r\n\r\nChoose boxing sports regime which you want to practice and start using it.\r\n\r\nIssue Reporting\r\n===============\r\n\r\nIf you find any issues, please directly report here in repository by creating\r\nnew issues.\r\n\r\n \r\n=\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHappy Boxing.\r\n=============\r\n",
